	abstract = {A Unified Account of Permutations in Modern {CombinatoricsA} 2006 {CHOICE} Outstanding Academic Title, the first edition of this bestseller was lauded for its detailed yet engaging treatment of permutations. Providing more than enough material for a one-semester course, Combinatorics of Permutations, Second Edition continues to clearly show the usefulness of this subject for both students and researchers and is recommended for undergraduate libraries by the {MAA}.  Expanded {ChaptersMuch} of the book has been significantly revised and extended. This edition includes a new section on alternating permutations and new material on multivariate applications of the exponential formula. It also discusses several important results in pattern avoidance as well as the concept of asymptotically normal distributions. New {ChapterAn} entirely new chapter focuses on three sorting algorithms from molecular biology. This emerging area of combinatorics is known for its easily stated and extremely difficult problems, which sometimes can be solved using deep techniques from seemingly remote branches of mathematics.  Additional Exercises and {ProblemsAll} chapters in the second edition have more exercises and problems. Exercises are marked according to level of difficulty and many of the problems encompass results from the last eight years.},

by establishing correspondences between these relations and some types of rhyming scheme
which are characterized by the planarity of certain graphical representations. These represerltai

Interpretations and proofs of a number of combinatorial identities are obtained.},
